Problem Statement


    The goal of this project is to compare the performance of different CNN architectures on
    various datasets. Specifically, we will evaluate LeNet-5, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet,
    ResNet, Xception, and SENet on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. The comparison
    will be based on metrics such as loss curves, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

    
Business Use Cases


    The insights from this project can be applied in various business scenarios, including:
    - Choosing the appropriate CNN architecture for specific computer vision tasks
    - Improving model performance by understanding the impact of dataset characteristics
    - Optimizing resource allocation by selecting models that offer the best trade-off between
    performance and computational cost

    
Approach


    1. Load and preprocess the datasets (MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10).
    2. Implement the following CNN architectures: LeNet-5, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet,
    ResNet, Xception, and SENet.
    3. Train each model on each dataset, recording the loss and accuracy metrics.
    4. Evaluate the performance of each model on the test sets using accuracy, precision, recall,
    and F1-score.
    5. Plot the loss curves and other performance metrics for comparison.
    6. Analyze the results to understand the impact of different architectures and datasets on
    model performance.

    
Results
    The expected outcomes of this project include:
    - Comparative loss curves for each model on each dataset
    - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each model on each dataset
    - Analysis of the results to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each architecture on
    different datasets
